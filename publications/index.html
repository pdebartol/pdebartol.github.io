To address this, we propose the QR-learner, a model-agnostic learner that estimates conditional average treatment effects (CATE) within the trial population by leveraging external data from other trials or observational studies. The proposed method is robust: it has the potential to reduce the CATE prediction mean squared error while maintaining consistency, even when the external data is not aligned with the trial. Moreover, we introduce a procedure that combines the QR-learner with a trial-only CATE learner and show that it asymptotically matches or exceeds the trial-only learner in terms of mean squared error. We examine the performance of our approach in simulation studies and apply the methods to a real-world dataset, demonstrating improvements in both CATE estimation and statistical power for detecting heterogeneous effects. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row col-sm"> <div id="demirel2025}" class="col-sm"> <div class="title">Uncovering Bias Mechanisms in Observational Studies</div> <div class="author"> Ilker Demirel, Zeshan Hussain, Piersilvio De Bartolomeis, and David Sontag </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>arXiv preprint,</em> 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01191" class="arxiv btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Observational studies are a key resource for causal inference but are often affected by systematic biases.

However, there remains a lack of methodology for uncovering the underlying mechanisms driving these biases, e.g., whether due to hidden confounding or selection of participants. In this work, we show that the relationship between bias magnitude and the predictive performance of nuisance function estimators (in the observational study) can help distinguish among common sources of causal bias. We validate our methodology through extensive synthetic experiments and a real-world case study, demonstrating its effectiveness in revealing the mechanisms behind observed biases.

On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row col-sm"> <div id="cadei2025causal" class="col-sm"> <div class="title">Prediction-Powered Causal Inferences</div> <div class="author"> Riccardo Cadei, Ilker Demirel*, Piersilvio De Bartolomeis*, Lukas Lindorfer, Sylvia Cremer, Cordelia Schmid, and Francesco Locatello </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS),</em> 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06343" class="arxiv btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>A plethora of real-world scientific investigations is waiting to scale with the support of trustworthy predictive models that can reduce the need for costly data annotations.

First, we show that factual outcome estimation via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) may fail to yield valid causal inferences on the target population, even in a randomized controlled experiment and infinite training samples. Then, we propose to leverage the observed experimental settings during training to empower generalization to downstream interventional investigations, “Causal Lifting” the predictive model. We propose Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization (DERM), a new simple learning procedure minimizing the risk over a fictitious target population, preventing potential confounding effects.

Yet, observational datasets are prone to confounding, potentially compromising the validity of conclusions. While adjusting for all available covariates is a common corrective strategy, this approach can introduce bias, especially when post-treatment variables are present or some variables remain unobserved—a frequent scenario in practice. Avoiding this bias often requires detailed knowledge of the underlying causal graph, a challenging and often impractical prerequisite. In this work, we propose RAMEN, an algorithm that tackles this challenge by leveraging the heterogeneity of multiple data sources without the need to know the complete causal graph. Notably, RAMEN achieves doubly robust identification: we identify the treatment effect if either the causal parents of the treatment or those of the outcome are observed.

Existing external control methods, however, can be biased if the populations underlying the trial and the external control data are not exchangeable. Here, we characterize a randomization-aware class of treatment effect estimators in the population underlying the trial that remain consistent and asymptotically normal when using external control data, even when exchangeability does not hold. We consider two members of this class of estimators: the well-known augmented inverse probability weighting trial-only estimator, which is the efficient estimator when only trial data are used; and a potentially more efficient member of the class when exchangeability holds and external control data are available, which we refer to as the optimized randomization-aware estimator. To achieve robust integration of external control data in trial analyses, we then propose a combined estimator based on the efficient trial-only estimator and the optimized randomization-aware estimator. We show that the combined estimator is consistent and no less efficient than the most efficient of the two component estimators, whether the exchangeability assumption holds or not.

This framework subsumes several applications of practical interest, such as pure exploration, imitation learning, and risk-averse RL, among others. However, the previous convex RL literature implicitly evaluates the agent’s performance over infinite realizations (or trials), while most of the applications require excellent performance over a handful, or even just one, trials. To meet this practical demand, we formulate convex RL in finite trials, where the objective is any convex function of the empirical state distribution computed over a finite number of realizations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the setting, which includes an analysis of the importance of non-Markovian policies to achieve optimality, as well as a characterization of the computational and statistical complexity of the problem in various configurations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row col-sm"> <div id="mutti2022challenging" class="col-sm"> <div class="title">Challenging Common Assumptions in Convex Reinforcement Learning</div> <div class="author"> Mirco Mutti*, Riccardo De Santi*, Piersilvio De Bartolomeis, and Marcello Restelli </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS),</em> 2022 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01511" class="arxiv btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/neurips_convex_poster.pdf" class="poster btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">poster</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The classic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation concerns the maximization of a scalar reward function. More recently, convex RL has been introduced to extend the RL formulation to all the objectives that are convex functions of the state distribution induced by a policy. Notably, convex RL covers several relevant applications that do not fall into the scalar formulation, including imitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure exploration. In classic RL, it is common to optimize an infinite trials objective, which accounts for the state distribution instead of the empirical state visitation frequencies, even though the actual number of trajectories is always finite in practice. This is theoretically sound since the infinite trials and finite trials objectives are equivalent and thus lead to the same optimal policy. In this paper, we show that this hidden assumption does not hold in convex RL. In particular, we prove that erroneously optimizing the infinite trials objective in place of the actual finite trials one, as it is usually done, can lead to a significant approximation error. Since the finite trials setting is the default in both simulated and real-world RL, we believe shedding light on this issue will lead to better approaches and methodologies for convex RL, impacting relevant research areas such as imitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure exploration among others.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> </div> <h4 id="workshops">workshops</h4> <div class="publications"> <ol class="bibliography"></ol> <ol class="bibliography"></ol> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row col-sm"> <div id="debartolomeis2023how" class="col-sm"> <div class="title">How robust accuracy suffers from certified training with convex relaxations</div> <div class="author"> Piersilvio De Bartolomeis, Jacob Clarysse, Amartya Sanyal, and Fanny Yang </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>I Can’t Believe It’s Not Better Workshop (NeurIPS), Oral, </em> 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">abstract</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06995" class="arxiv btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">arXiv</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Adversarial attacks pose significant threats to deploying state-of-the-art classifiers in safety-critical applications. Two classes of methods have emerged to address this issue: empirical defences and certified defences. Although certified defences come with robustness guarantees, empirical defences such as adversarial training enjoy much higher popularity among practitioners. In this paper, we systematically compare the standard and robust error of these two robust training paradigms across multiple computer vision tasks. We show that in most tasks and for both \(\ell_∞\)-ball and \(\ell_2\)-ball threat models, certified training with convex relaxations suffers from worse standard and robust error than adversarial training. We further explore how the error gap between certified and adversarial training depends on the threat model and the data distribution. In particular, besides the perturbation budget, we identify as important factors the shape of the perturbation set and the implicit margin of the data distribution.
