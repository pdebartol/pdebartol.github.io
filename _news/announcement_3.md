I have been invited to present our paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04262">Efficient Randomized Experiments Using Foundation Models</a> at the <a href="https://carswg.github.io/journalclub/journalclub12.html">American Statistical Association Covariate Adjustment Group</a>, which brings together statisticians from academia and pharma. The slides can be found <a href="https://pdebartol.github.io/assets/pdf/presentation_haipw.pdf">here</a>.
