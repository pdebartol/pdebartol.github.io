I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/"> Fanny Yang</a>, and part of the <a href="https://ml.inf.ethz.ch/">Institute for Machine Learning</a>. I was previously an Applied Scientist Intern at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/">Amazon Science</a> in Seattle, where I worked on machine learning and experimentation to select the best product offers for customers. Before that, I was a visiting graduate student at Harvard University, hosted by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/issa-dahabreh/">Issa Dahabreh</a> in the <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/"> CAUSALab</a>. 

My current research focuses on **trial augmentation** - a new line of work that improves the efficiency of clinical trials by safely integrating external data and flexible machine learning models into trial design and analysis.
