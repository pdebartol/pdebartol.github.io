I am a PhD student in the Computer Science Department at ETH ZÃ¼rich, advised by <a href="https://sml.inf.ethz.ch/group/fannyy/"> Fanny Yang</a>. I am currently doing an internship at <a href="https://www.amazon.science/"> Amazon Science</a> in Seattle. During my studies, I was also a visiting graduate student at Harvard University, hosted by <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/profile/issa-dahabreh/">Issa Dahabreh</a> in the <a href="https://causalab.sph.harvard.edu/"> CAUSALab</a>. 

I am broadly interested in the foundations of causality and its healthcare applications. Currently, I am working on improving the efficiency of randomized experiments by integrating foundation models trained on external data sources; see e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04262">our latest work</a>.
