     abstract={Randomized trials are considered the gold standard for making informed decisions in medicine, yet they often lack generalizability to the patient populations in clinical practice.  Observational studies, on the other hand, cover a broader patient population but are prone to various biases. Thus, before using an observational study for decision-making, it is crucial to benchmark its treatment effect estimates against those derived from a randomized trial. 
We propose a novel strategy to benchmark observational studies beyond the average treatment effect. First, we design a statistical test for the null hypothesis that the treatment effects, conditioned on a set of relevant features, differ up to some tolerance. We then estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the maximum bias strength for any subgroup in the observational study.  Finally, we validate our benchmarking strategy in a real-world setting and show that it leads to conclusions that align with established medical knowledge.}

   abstract={Computational tools, such as TRIALSCOPE, can support target trial emulations by leveraging biomedical language models to automate information extraction from unstructured data, conduct data validation, and streamline statistical analysis and model assessment. These advances promise to improve the quality of research using electronic health record data for causal inference. Nevertheless, automation cannot, on its own, address biases inherent in the process of generating observational data, such as unmeasured confounding. When these biases affect emulation results and a new randomized trial is deemed necessary, emulations aided by automation may still be valuable for informing trial design via realistic simulations, and for improving the efficiency of randomized trials via trial augmentation methods that combine the power of randomization with large-scale observational data.}

  abstract={Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with substantial uncertainty. On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone.}

  abstract={A plethora of real-world scientific investigations is waiting to scale with the support of trustworthy predictive models that can reduce the need for costly data annotations. We focus on causal inferences on a target experiment with unlabeled factual outcomes, retrieved by a predictive model fine-tuned on a labeled similar experiment. First, we show that factual outcome estimation via Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) may fail to yield valid causal inferences on the target population, even in a randomized controlled experiment and infinite training samples. Then, we propose to leverage the observed experimental settings during training to empower generalization to downstream interventional investigations, ``Causal Lifting'' the predictive model. We propose Deconfounded Empirical Risk Minimization (DERM), a new simple learning procedure minimizing the risk over a fictitious target population, preventing potential confounding effects. We validate our method on both synthetic and real-world scientific data. Notably, for the first time, we zero-shot generalize causal inferences on ISTAnt dataset (without annotation) by causal lifting a predictive model on our experiment variant.}

     abstract={Practical and ethical constraints often dictate the use of observational data for causal inference, particularly in medicine and social sciences. Yet, observational datasets are prone to confounding, potentially compromising the validity of conclusions. While adjusting for all available covariates is a common corrective strategy, this approach can introduce bias, especially when post-treatment variables are present or some variables remain unobservedâ€”a frequent scenario in practice. Avoiding this bias often requires detailed knowledge of the underlying causal graph, a challenging and often impractical prerequisite. In this work, we propose RAMEN, an algorithm that tackles this challenge by leveraging the heterogeneity of multiple data sources without the need to know the complete causal graph. Notably, RAMEN achieves doubly robust identification: we identify the treatment effect if either the causal parents of the treatment or those of the outcome are observed. Empirical evaluations across synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.}

Then, we use the test to estimate an asymptotically valid lower bound on the unobserved confounding strength. We evaluate the power and validity of our statistical test on several synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.

      abstract={Convex Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a recently introduced framework that generalizes the standard RL objective to any convex (or concave) function of the state distribution induced by the agent's policy. This framework subsumes several applications of practical interest, such as pure exploration, imitation learning, and risk-averse RL, among others. However, the previous convex RL literature implicitly evaluates the agent's performance over infinite realizations (or trials), while most of the applications require excellent performance over a handful, or even just one, trials.
To meet this practical demand, we formulate convex RL in finite trials, where the objective is any convex function of the empirical state distribution computed over a finite number of realizations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive theoretical study of the setting, which includes an analysis of the importance of non-Markovian policies to achieve optimality, as well as a characterization of the computational and statistical complexity of the problem in various configurations.},

      abstract={The classic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation concerns the maximization of a scalar reward function. More recently, convex RL has been introduced to extend the RL formulation to all the objectives that are convex functions of the state distribution induced by a policy. Notably, convex RL covers several relevant applications that do not fall into the scalar formulation, including imitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure exploration. In classic RL, it is common to optimize an infinite trials objective, which accounts for the state distribution instead of the empirical state visitation frequencies, even though the actual number of trajectories is always finite in practice. This is theoretically sound since the infinite trials and finite trials objectives are equivalent and thus lead to the same optimal policy. In this paper, we show that this hidden assumption does not hold in convex RL. In particular, we prove that erroneously optimizing the infinite trials objective in place of the actual finite trials one, as it is usually done, can lead to a significant approximation error. Since the finite trials setting is the default in both simulated and real-world RL, we believe shedding light on this issue will lead to better approaches and methodologies for convex RL, impacting relevant research areas such as imitation learning, risk-averse RL, and pure exploration among others.},

  abstract={One approach for increasing the efficiency of randomized trials is the use of "external controls" -- individuals who received the control treatment studied in the trial during routine practice or in prior experimental studies. Existing external control methods, however, can be biased if the populations underlying the trial and the external control data are not exchangeable. Here, we characterize a randomization-aware class of treatment effect estimators in the population underlying the trial that remain consistent and asymptotically normal when using external control data, even when exchangeability does not hold. We consider two members of this class of estimators: the well-known augmented inverse probability weighting trial-only estimator, which is the efficient estimator when only trial data are used; and a potentially more efficient member of the class when exchangeability holds and external control data are available, which we refer to as the optimized randomization-aware estimator. To achieve robust integration of external control data in trial analyses, we then propose a combined estimator based on the efficient trial-only estimator and the optimized randomization-aware estimator. We show that the combined estimator is consistent and no less efficient than the most efficient of the two component estimators, whether the exchangeability assumption holds or not. We examine the estimators' performance in simulations and we illustrate their use with data from two trials of paliperidone extended-release for schizophrenia.}
